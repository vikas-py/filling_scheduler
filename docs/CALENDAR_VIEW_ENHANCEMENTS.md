# Calendar View Enhancement Summary

## Problem
The calendar view was showing filler numbers in tooltips, but not displaying lot IDs or other important information directly on the calendar items themselves. Users had to hover to see any details.

## Solution
Enhanced the calendar view to display more information directly on calendar items while maintaining clean, readable layouts across all three view modes (Day, Week, Month).

## Changes Made

### 1. **Day View Improvements**
**Before:** Single line showing only activity type and filler
```
LOT (F1)
```

**After:** Multi-line display with lot ID, filler, time, and product type
```
Lot LOT-2025-001
Filler 1 • 08:00 AM
VialA
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Lot ID prominently displayed
- ✅ Filler number and start time on second line
- ✅ Product/lot type on third line (if available)
- ✅ Enhanced tooltips with full details including:
  - Duration
  - Time range
  - Unit counts (for FILL activities)

### 2. **Week View Improvements**
**Before:** Simple chips with just lot abbreviation
```
[L001]
```

**After:** Inline display with lot ID and filler
```
[L001 (F1)]
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Lot ID visible at a glance
- ✅ Filler number shown inline
- ✅ Better visual distinction with colored left border
- ✅ Box layout instead of chip for more flexibility
- ✅ Enhanced tooltips with lot type and unit counts

### 3. **Month View Improvements**
**Before:** Minimal display with just lot abbreviation
```
L001
```

**After:** Compact display with lot ID and filler
```
L001 F1
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Lot ID shown in bold
- ✅ Filler number in smaller font
- ✅ Space-efficient layout
- ✅ Enhanced tooltips with comprehensive details

### 4. **Bug Fixes**
- ✅ Fixed property names: `activity.kind` instead of `activity.type`
- ✅ Fixed property names: `activity.lot_type` instead of `activity.product`
- ✅ Added helper functions for consistent labeling:
  - `getActivityLabel()` - Returns full label like "Lot LOT-001" or "CLEAN"
  - `getShortActivityLabel()` - Returns abbreviated label like "L001" or "CLEAN"
- ✅ Improved activity color mapping to handle all activity kinds

### 5. **Enhanced Tooltips**
All tooltips now show:
- ✅ Activity type/lot ID
- ✅ Filler number
- ✅ Lot type/product (if available)
- ✅ Start and end times
- ✅ Duration
- ✅ Unit counts (for FILL activities)

## Visual Comparison

### Day View
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Lot LOT-2025-001            │ ← Lot ID visible
│ Filler 1 • 08:00 AM         │ ← Filler + Time
│ VialA                       │ ← Product type
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Week View
```
┌──────────────┐
│ L001 (F1)    │ ← Both lot and filler visible
└──────────────┘
```

### Month View
```
┌────────┐
│ L001 F1│ ← Compact but informative
└────────┘
```

## Technical Details

### Property Mapping
| Old (Incorrect) | New (Correct) | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| `activity.type` | `activity.kind` | Activity type field name |
| `activity.product` | `activity.lot_type` | Product/type field name |

### Activity Types Handled
- **FILL** / **LOT** - Blue, shows lot ID
- **CLEAN** - Orange, shows "CLEAN"
- **CHANGEOVER** - Orange, shows "CHANGEOVER"
- **IDLE** - Gray, shows "IDLE"

### Helper Functions Added
```typescript
// Get full activity label
getActivityLabel(activity) → "Lot LOT-001" or "CLEAN"

// Get abbreviated label
getShortActivityLabel(activity) → "L001" or "CLEAN"

// Get color by activity kind
getActivityColor(kind) → "#2196f3" (blue for FILL)
```

## Summary

The calendar view now provides much more useful information at a glance while maintaining clean, readable layouts. Users can immediately see:
- **What** is being produced (Lot ID)

This makes the calendar view a more practical tool for understanding and communicating production schedules! 📅✨
